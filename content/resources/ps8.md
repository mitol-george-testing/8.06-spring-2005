description: "Problem set on quantum physics. Problems include: Using the semiclassical\
  \ approximation on the ground state, quantum mechanics of a bouncing ball, application\
  \ of the semiclassical method to the double well potential, vibrational and rotational\
  \ spectra in the Born\xAD-Oppenheimer approximation, adiabatic spin rotation, and\
  \ engineering adiabatic transitions.\r\n\r\n"
